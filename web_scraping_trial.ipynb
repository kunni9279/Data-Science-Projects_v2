      "I might be biased, bc I’m dutch. But I think we stand a chance, we have a great team. The greatest defence in the world and some of the best midfielders. The attack falls a little short, but is still decent enough. The only issue is the striker position. Memphis Depay is good enough(was horrible last euros, but has gotten in shape again), but if he gets injured we’re pretty fucked. We were incredibly poor last euros, but since then, a lot of our players have improved at their clubs(Gravenberch and Reijnders) or returned from injury(Timber and de Jong). So I’m hopeful\n",

Despite us having lost three finals already, whereas Portugal has only become a good side about 20 years ago. But they’re good, they did draw Hungary at home recently, which makes me hopeful. For the rest, they do select a lot of Saudi players, which can definitely backfire against top countries. However, their PSG players are incredibly dangerous and kinda scary.\n",
      "England\n",

      "Spain\n",
      "The obvious favourites imo. They lost the Nations League final to Portugal, but they do look the strongest in most matches. However, in terms of player quality, they aren’t as good as England imo. They’re quite comparable to Portugal and the Netherlands in terms of the level of their players.\n",

      "Germany - even though they are not the Germany that won the 2014 world cup, they have a chance to win. I see them at Quarter Finals.\n",
      "Spain - 2010 world cup winners. I wouldn't doubt Spain even though the golden generation has passed. Sergio Ramos, David Silva, David Villa, Fernando Torres, Iniesta, Xavier, Capedevilla, Puyol are all gone now. With this new generation, its gonna be interesting. As you may know, Spain didn't perform well in the last 2 world cups but it may change or it could be the same fate again in the round of 16.\n",
      "Brazil - 6 time world cup winner. Last time Brazil won was back in 2002 when Japan and Korea hosted. The Brazilian team today isnt the same as it was before but I think they have a good chance. It's overdue but I see them at Quarter Finals and maybe Semi Finals. The past few world cups wasnt good to them with Croatia beating Brazil (2022) and Belgium (2018), Colombia (2014).\n",
      "Croatia - World Cup finalist. I had to mention Croatia because they came out of nowhere. Before they were just a mid team but recent years had shown how good Croatia become. They could pull a miracle and do it again. I'm giving them Quarter final/Semi Finals.\n",
      "Uruguay - World Cup winner (1930)(1950). Now this team has been improving over the years and I think they can be Semi Finalists/Finalists. I think Uruguay is massively overdue for a historic run. After seeing their performances recently, they are strong contenders for a World Cup trophy.\n",
      "Portugal - 3rd place winner (1966). The team they have now is much better. The problem they had in the last one was putting Cristiano Ronaldo on the side when they faced against Morrocco. If they had put Cristiano, they wouldn't fumbled. But at this point, Cristiano isn't the same anymore. So it would make sense to put him as a sub unless I'm proven wrong. But anyways, the team is looking good. I see them going to Quarter Finals and maybe they reach Finals (if the Simpson theory is correct)\n",

      "Spain, Germany or France. But since the tournament is still 15 months away (a lifetime in football), things could change drastically. From the Americas, only Argentina could be a contender. Italy England and the Netherlands could be dark horses. Portugal could crash the party.\n",
      "Ok, who am I kidding??? . “Football will still not be coming home”. England would do England again.\n",

      "Argentina because they have a very strong and talented players. There participation in 2022 world cup was amazing. So looking forward for this team to win. This player's have a lot of quality in them. Another option can be Spain\n",

What are some of the reasons that make the supporters\n",
      "There are five reasons that Argentina can win the FIFA World Cup 2022\n",
      "The Football World Cup is starting from November 21. As usual, Argentina is on the list of favorites for this World Cup 2022 to be held in Qatar.\n",
      "Almost everyone is sure, that this is the last time Lionel Messi will play on the stage of the World Cup. Lionel Messi, who has never won the World Cup, will be able to open the door? Argentina fans, who won the Copa America last year and lost the title to the 28-year-old, are hopeful that the World Cup drought will end this time. What are some of the reasons that make the supporters so optimistic? Let’s see!\n",
      "1. Reliance on Lionel Messi\n",
      "It is crazy to explain the importance of having Lionel Messi in the team in 2022. There is nothing new to say about how great an asset Lionel Messi is for the team if he is in form. This is the biggest question a year ago, whether Messi has done exactly what he has done for the club in the last decade and a half, or for the national team. Winning the Copa America last year also put an end to that question for skeptics. The rest is just the World Cup.\n",
      "Lionel Messi’s eagerness to win the World Cup can be seen in the way he plays. Earlier, he was in charge of the attack on the national team jersey, but he did not want to press that way. Now, if necessary, Lionel Messi can be seen pressing the opponent in the middle. Fortunately for Lionel Messi, as in the past, other Argentine players would have forgotten about team chemistry whenever they saw the ball at Lionel Messi’s feet, but that is no longer the case.\n",
      "When you see Lionel Messi coming down, there is the presence of Lautaro Martinez, Angel Di Maria, Nicolas Gonzalez, and Alejandro Gomez in the opponent’s box. As a result, if Lionel Messi goes down, Argentina will not have to worry about who will be there to score goals. Which has made Lionel Messi more dependent on the Argentine jersey than ever before. And if Lionel Messi is relied on, the drought of international titles can be overcome, as Argentina has proved by winning the Copa America and La Finalisima.\n",
      "2. A sense of party brotherhood\n",
      "When players go to practice camp to play a match for Argentina, keep a close eye on their activities on social media. The group photos posted by Rodrigo Di Paul, Leandro Pardes, Paolo DiBalla, Anhel Di Maria, Cristian Romero, and Emiliano Martinez seem to sing the praises of party brotherhood.\n",
      "Proving that the players of the team are not at least isolated from each other, their relationship is strong. And a strong relationship between the players is the key to the success of any team, who does not know!\n",
      "Everyone has accepted Lionel Messi as the sole leader of the team with a smile. Everyone in the team is eager to do something for Messi. Everyone’s personal relationship with Messi is at another level, with these new teammates, it is clear that Messi himself is enjoying the game in the national team more than ever.\n",
      "3. Defense\n",
      "Under Diego Maradona, the 2010 World Cup saw Argentina dive into the match. No one played as a fullback. Legendary right-back Javier Janetti has not been picked, left-winger Honas Gutierrez has been played as a right-back, and center-backs like Nicolas Burdiso, Nicolas Otamendi or Clement Rodriguez have played as fullbacks. In 2014, Alejandro Sabeya conducted regular experiments with the XI table, even though there was not much matching.\n",
      "Argentina started the tournament at 3-5-2 and then went on to play 4-3-3, taking refuge in the quarter-finals against Belgium 4-4-2. The 2018 World Cup also reminded me of the 2010 World Cup in terms of defense. Coach Jorge Sampaoli was skeptical about who would play as a fullback, whether Argentina would play with 3 defenders or 4 defenders.\n",
      "But he has no problem in this Argentina. Christian Romero next to Nicolas Otamendi. The rightback is Nahuel Molina, not Gonzalo Montiel. Left-back Marcos Acuna and Nicolas Tagliafico, either. Players like Lisandro Martinez, Juan Foyth, and German Pezzella are not yet part of the original XI, but whenever they get a chance, they identify themselves.\n",
      "The bottom line is that there is no shortage of effective players in the Argentine defense. Argentina is playing regularly in the six-man defense. And coach Lionel Scaloni knows very well when and how to use these players. Despite the pressure of the opponent, the mutual understanding is good, so Argentina is able to provide one-on-one ball from the defense.\n",
      "4. Lionel Scaloni\n",
      "lionel scaloni\n",
      "Images Via AFA\n",
      "Argentina have begun to rely on new coach Lionel Scaloni. From the beginning, he has got the opportunity to form a squad of his choice by swapping multiple players. He knows the strengths and weaknesses of everyone in this group like the palm of his hand.\n",
      "The coach is making maximum use of the 4-3-3 table, not experimenting too much, and playing result-oriented football, which is playing a positive role at the end of the day. That is to say, the 32 consecutive matches were unbeaten after losing in the 2019 Copa America semis. Scaloni has taught Messi team pressure in an effective way, which can be understood by watching Argentina play.\n",
      "5. Emiliano Martinez\n",
      "Argentina’s cry for the goalkeeper is not today. Leo Franco has been ruled out of the 2006 World Cup quarter-final against Germany following the injury of key goalkeeper Roberto Abondanzieri, who was unable to help Argentina in a penalty shootout. Then came Sergio Romero. The penalty shootout in the semi-finals of the 2014 World Cup is the exception, or Romero could not rely on Argentina in his entire career.\n",
      "Willy Caballero and Franco Armani’s ridiculous mistake in the last World Cup has become a thorn in the side of Argentine fans. However, none of them, coach Scaloni’s main goalkeeper is now Emiliano Martinez. And Martinez has all the qualities he needs to be a world-class goalkeeper, as he proved in the last Copa America semi-final and final.\n",
      "On current form and team strength, France and England look like the favourites.\n",
      "Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Portugal and the Netherlands will also be in with a shout.\n",
      "I personally think Germany will recover by 2026 and be contenders too. Perhaps also Italy.\n",
      "Not Belgium - they are in decline.\n"
