**PROJECT 6 - ENSEMBLE LEARNING**
- Utilized ensemble machine learning techniques such as Bagging, XGBoost, Stacking, and Voting Classifiers to build predictive models.
- Developed and deployed an interactive Streamlit application for real-time prediction of weather conditions and day of the week.
- Integrated multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and performance through ensemble learning strategies.
- Designed the application interface to allow user-friendly input and clear visualization of prediction outputs.

**PROJECT 5 - CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS**
-	Utilized Python to analyze 1,000 credit applications and gain insights into whether the risk level associated with each applicant was acceptable or required further review
-	Thoroughly analyzed the dataset using visualizations such as scatter plots, violin plots, and box plots to identify trends and outliers
-	Used CatBoostClassifier to predict the risk and compile a professional report
-	Built an interactive Credit Risk Prediction app using Streamlit for real-time risk assessment

**PROJECT 4 - APARTMENT PRICE ANALYSIS** 
-	Used machine learning methods in python to analyze apartment prices using data driven techniques to understand the factors that influence property values
-	It can be observed that the majority of semi-furnished or fully furnished apartments are located near main roads which influence prices
-	Only a small fractions of houses without basements are preferred
-	Provided technical insights on how machine learning models can be optimized by feature selection and preprocessing techniques to better predict apartment prices

**PROJECT 3(NLP)-TEXT ANALYSIS**                                                                                        
-	Webscraped input data from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup
-	Transformed and processed data by using python to ensure data completeness and validity
-	Utilized spaCy to extract and analyze 204 Wikipedia sentences, performing topic analysis to identify key themes and contextual relationships
-	Used NLTK to perform sentiment analysis and interpret the emotional tone of the extracted sentences
-	Also performed sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews data and generated the classification report

**PROJECT 2-STATEWISE LOAN ANALYSIS** 
-	Loaded and visualized loan data using Python to uncover key patterns in statewise loan distribution across India
-	Analyzed income distribution across different employment types and state profiles
-	Transformed and aggregated data to visualize loan amounts by employment profile across states
-	Used different supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques for loan data analysis

**PROJECT 1-VISUALIZATION**
-	Web-scraped population data from Wikipedia using Python
-	Extracted and structured tabular data with BeautifulSoup, creating a clean pandas DataFrame
-	Visualized continent-wise and country-wise population trends using line and pie charts
-	Used FacetGrid to illustrate continent-wise population changes over time for comparative analysis
